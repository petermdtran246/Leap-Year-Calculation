Leap Year Checker

Overview
This program determines whether a given year is a leap year or not based on specific criteria. A leap year is a year that contains an extra day, making it 366 days long instead of the usual 365. Leap years are determined using the following rules:

Every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder is considered a leap year.
However, years divisible by 100 with no remainder are not leap years, except...
If the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder, then it is still considered a leap year.

Usage
To use the Leap Year Checker, simply input the year you want to check when prompted. The program will then analyze the input and determine whether it is a leap year or not based on the rules outlined above.
